                <p>
                    Hi! I’m Connor. I’m the person building BonsAI, and I’m
                    based in the United States. You can learn more about my
                    background on <a
                        href="https://crforsythe.github.io/"
                        class="underline hover:text-olive-growth"
                        >my personal website</a
                    >.
                </p>

                <p>
                    BonsAI started as a personal project, but it exists because
                    I kept running into the same pattern over and over: modern
                    AI tools ask users to make tradeoffs that many people aren’t
                    comfortable with.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Most cloud AI products are built around recurring revenue.
                    That business model creates incentives I don’t love:
                    collecting as much data as possible, keeping users locked
                    in, and quietly trading privacy for convenience. Even when
                    intentions are good, the pressure to grow often pushes
                    products in directions users never asked for.
                </p>

                <p>
                    I also worry about the environmental cost of always-on cloud
                    infrastructure. Training and running massive models in data
                    centers isn’t free (financially or environmentally) and
                    those costs are usually invisible to the people using the
                    tools.
                </p>

                <p>BonsAI is my attempt at a different approach.</p>

                <p>
                    It runs locally. It stores your data on your machine. It
                    works offline. When it uses the internet, it does so only
                    when you explicitly ask. There are no accounts, no
                    analytics, and no background data collection.
                </p>

                <p>
                    I’m not funded by advertisers, investors, or data brokers.
                    BonsAI isn’t designed to extract value from you. Rather,
                    it’s designed to be useful, understandable, and owned by the
                    person using it.
                </p>

                <p>
                    I don’t believe software needs to be complicated or
                    intrusive to be powerful. I believe in small, carefully
                    built tools with clear boundaries. If BonsAI ever changes
                    direction, I believe users deserve to know.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Best,<br />
                    Connor
